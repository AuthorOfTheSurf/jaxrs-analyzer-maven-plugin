= JAX-RS Analyzer Maven Plugin
Sebastian Daschner

Maven plugin for the JAX-RS Analyzer.

To enable the plugin, simply add these lines to your pom.xml in the `<plugins>` section.

NOTE: This will work, as soon as the project is on Maven Central. Until then the project (including the JAX-RS Analyzer) has to be built manually.

After building your project, the documentation resides under 'target/jaxrs-analyzer/'.

== Backends

=== Plain text

The plain text backend simply generates a test file with all REST resources.

=== Swagger

The swagger backend generates a swagger.json which can be loaded by the swagger-ui.

 Swagger UI is a dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate beautiful documentation from a Swagger-compliant API.
